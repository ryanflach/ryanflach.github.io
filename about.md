This site was built as part of the pre-work for module 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. Implementation was based on the "spicy" variation in which it was built using only the instructions found in the Jekyll documentation. It is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

_This site is built using a slightly modified version of the base Jekyll theme. You can find more information about Jekyll [here](http://jekyllrb.com)._
